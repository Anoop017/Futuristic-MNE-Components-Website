Create a modern, professional, mobile-friendly website using only HTML, vanilla CSS, and JavaScript for a manufacturing company named **MNE Components India Pvt. Ltd.**

Use the following as references:
1. The company’s existing website: https://mnecomponents.com/
2. The design inspiration: https://ennovi.com/

Requirements:
- Clean, highly polished UI with subtle but professional animations and transitions
- Responsive design (mobile-first, fully adaptive to all screen sizes)
- Smooth scroll behavior and sticky navbar with active section highlighting
- **Hero Section** with banner image, powerful heading, tagline, and a call-to-action button like “Explore More” or “Contact Us”
- **About Section** with a brief company profile, mission, and core strengths
- **Products Section** with a responsive grid layout of the company’s products (use placeholder images and titles for now), each card should animate on hover
- **Careers Section** with a brief message like “Work with Us” and a button or email link to send resumes
- **Contact Section** with:
  - Company address
  - Embedded Google Map (use a dummy map for now)
  - Social media links (LinkedIn, Instagram, Email)
  - A clean contact form with Name, Email, and Message fields (no backend needed)
- **Footer** with company branding and navigation links
- Smooth animations: fade-ins on scroll, hover effects on product cards/buttons, sliding or fade transitions between sections
- Optional: a simple page loader or intro animation (non-intrusive)
- Use a consistent color theme and elegant typography inspired by ennovi.com

Important:
- Use clean, well-commented HTML/CSS/JS
- No external frameworks like Bootstrap or jQuery — only pure HTML, CSS, and JS
- Keep the structure maintainable and scalable for future updates

Folder structure:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
- `assets/` for placeholder images or icons

This is only a frontend project — no backend or server integration is needed.
